there are 5 possible combinations of various variable and domain values ordering. To run the program write in command line python exam.py <i>
, i=1->mrv-forward_checking-lcv, , i=2->forward_checking-dom/wdeg-lcv, i=3->mac-mrv-lcv,i=4->mac-dom/wdeg-lcv, i=5->min conflicts. Dom/wdeg heuristic function
